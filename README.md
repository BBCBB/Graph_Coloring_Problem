# Graph_Coloring_Problem
This code is under review and improvement to tackle challenging problems in terms of size and diversity.
in order to solve this problem efficiently in terms of the solving time and the quality of the solution (how you can color the graph with the minimum number of colors) you need to know about constraint programming and symmetry breaking approaches. However, there is not a uniform and predefined strategy to do so. First Fail Principle can be helpful in many areas, which states that “To succeed, try first where you are most likely to fail.”
