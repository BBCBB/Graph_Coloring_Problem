# Graph_Coloring_Problem
This code is under review and improvement to tackle challenging problems in terms of size and diversity.
In order to solve this problem efficiently in terms of the solving time and the quality of the solution (how you can color the graph with the minimum number of colors), you need to know about constraint programming and symmetry breaking approaches. However, there is not a uniform and predefined strategy to do so. First Fail Principle can be helpful in many areas, which states that “To succeed, try first where you are most likely to fail.” In other words, you need to prioritize the nodes that have the most degrees.
I have tried two strategies so far. In the first one, I let the algorithm choose the nodes based on their degrees, and in the second one, I tried the saturation degree of the nodes firstly, and if it was the same for multiple nodes, I chose the node with the largest degree. Surprisingly, the first one performs better than the latter (Coloring_Sat in the repository). In the next step, I will try other approaches like letting in different permutations when the chromatic number of the graph exceeds an upper bound.
